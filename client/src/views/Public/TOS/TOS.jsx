          account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity
          that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your

        <p>
          When you create a callpepper.co account, we consider that to be an
          inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may
          contact you to share more details about what we have to offer.
          Don&#39;t worry -- if you aren&#39;t interested in learning more, you
          can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it&#39;s an email,

          web pages that link to, or are linked from, callpepper.co or our other
          Services. For example:
        </p>

        <ul>

            represent or imply that we endorse such website.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect
            yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan
            horses, and other harmful or destructive content.
          </li>
          <li>
            We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from
            non-Buzzword Labs websites.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are
          offered for a fee, such as Pepper (collectively, “Paid Services”). By
          using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees (for
          example, <a href="https://callpepper.co">Pepper fees</a>. Depending on
          the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee, recurring fees, or
          revenue-based fee. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in
          regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, or
          annually), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at
          any time (see &quot;Cancelling Automatic Renewal&quot; below).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless
          explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable
          federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods
          and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force
          or enacted in the future (“Taxes”). You are responsible for payment of
          all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your
          payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect
          Taxes on the Fees you’ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for
          such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails or if Paid Services
          are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, we may immediately
          cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your
          bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees
          for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in
          general.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service,
          recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that
          unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable
          subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us
          to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you
          to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any
          Taxes). By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same
          interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if
          you purchase a callpepper.co monthly plan, you will be charged each
          month. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of
          the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you
          are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order
          to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal.
          The date for the automatic renewal is determined automatically based
          on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and
          cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service’s site. For
          example, you can unsubscribe from Pepper by going to your user
          dashboard and unsubscribing from the payment menu. Deleting your
          account also triggers an automatic unsubscription from our service.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Fee Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time, or
          start charging fees for Services that were previously free. When
          applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you
          don’t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Refunds.</strong> While you may cancel a Paid Service at any
          time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise
          required by applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes</h2>

        <p>
          We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we
          have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered.
          These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an
          authorized executive of Buzzword Labs, or by the posting by Buzzword
          Labs of a revised version. If we make changes that are material, we
          will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an
          email or other communication before the changes take effect. The
          notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new
          terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you

          will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose

          sole discretion, terminate or deny access to and use of any of our
          Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no
          obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
